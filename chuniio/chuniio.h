   CHUNITHM CUSTOM IO API. TAKEN FROM https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Dniel97/segatools/src/branch/develop/chuniio/chuniio.h

   Changelog:

   - 0x0100: Initial API version (assumed if chuni_io_get_api_version is not
	 exported)
   - 0x0101: Fix IR beam mappings
   - 0x0102: Add air tower led and billboard support

   Both bit masks are active-high.

   Note that you cannot instantly break the entire IR grid in a single frame to
   simulate hand movement; this will be judged as a miss. You need to simulate
   a gradual raising and lowering of the hands. Consult the proof-of-concept
   implementation for details.

   NOTE: Previous releases of Segatools mapped the IR beam inputs incorrectly.
   Please ensure that you advertise an API version of at least 0x0101 so that
   the correct mapping can be used.
